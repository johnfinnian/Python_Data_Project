### Visualize Data

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(job_titles), 1)

for i, job_title in enumerate(job_titles):
    df_plot = df_skills_perc[df_skills_perc['job_title_short'] == job_title].head(5)
    sns.barplot(data=df_plot, x='skills_percent', y='job_skills', ax=ax[i], hue='skill_count', palette='dark:b_r')
  
plt.show()

```
